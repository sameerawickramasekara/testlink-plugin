        When enabled, the plug-in matches the TestNG result suite name against the platform name defined, only if platform name is equal to suite name the test cases will be updated. This is mostly applicable when multiple platform are updated at the same time.
        If the same tests are executed in each platform there should be a way to differentiate the results based on the executed platform, so this can be done by the suite name of TestNG result file.
